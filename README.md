Supplementary material of "Population segmentation and transition probability estimation using data on health and health-related social service needs from the US Health and Retirement Study"

This GitHub repository provides the code explained in the following manuscript:
* [Authors]. Population segmentation and transition probability estimation using data on health and health-related social service needs from the US Health and Retirement Study. *Submitted for publication.* (Link to article).

I recommend to first read the manuscript before using the code. 

## Data
This project requires raw data to be downloaded from the [Health and Retirement Study (HRS) platform for researchers](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/). The daw data required for segmentation are public datasets, accessable to all persons with a registered HRS user account. Detailed instructions on downloading the data can be found in the first script of the first section in the project __01_Population_Segmentation__, called __01_Data_Extraction.ipynb__.

## 01_Population_Segmentation
This first section adapts a validated instrument for segmenting individuals by distinct, homogenous health and health-related social service needs to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative survey dataset from the US population aged 50 years and older.

The "***.ipynb" files are the same code included in the appendix of the paper. The code was written in Jupyter Notebook in a markdown format. 

## 02_Transition_Probability_Estimation
The second section section of the project estimates the one-year transition probabilities across all 10 need states and death using multi-state modelling.

The "***.R" files have the same code included in the appendix of the paper. The code was written in R with .
