Supplementary material of "Population segmentation and transition probability estimation using data on health and health-related social service needs from the US Health and Retirement Study"

This GitHub repository provides the code explained in the following manuscript:
* [Authors]. Population segmentation and transition probability estimation using data on health and health-related social service needs from the US Health and Retirement Study. *Submitted for publication.* (Link to article).

I recommend to first read the manuscript before using the code. 

## Population segmentation
This first section adapts a validated instrument for segmenting individuals by distinct, homogenous health and health-related social service needs to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative survey dataset from the US population aged 50 years and older.

The "***.ipynb" files are the same code included in the appendix of the paper. The code was written in Jupyter Notebook in a markdown format. 

## Transition probability estimation
The second section section estimates the one-year transition probabilities across all 10 need states and death using multi-state modelling.

The "***.R" file has the same code included in the appendix of the paper. The Markdown folder contains a more detailed description of the method and evaluation.

All code is explained in more detail in the markdown PDF (link to PDF).
